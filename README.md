# Python-Isosurface-Notebooks
Python implementations of iso surface algorithms nicely laid out in jupyter notebooks. This project was meant for processing .nii files (ct scan imaging files) so that is what it takes as input. 

I included one label file to tryout. This was the same that was used for the pictures in the libre office impress. Also included is a libre office impress presentation about the project. You could try give this file as volume input aswell but you might have to download a dataset. [This](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CT-ORG:+CT+volumes+with+multiple+organ+segmentations) is the dataset I used. 

Implemented algorithms are: 
- Marching Cubes
- Marching  Tetrahedra 
- Non functional Dual Contouring.

Installing pymesh is nearly really hard on windows. 

Happy isomeshing! I hope this project is usefull to someone ðŸ˜€
